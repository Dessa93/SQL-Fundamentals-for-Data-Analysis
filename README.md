# üíæ SQL Fundamentals for Data Analysis

This repository is designed as a **practical, beginner-friendly guide** to the fundamentals of **SQL (Structured Query Language)**, with a focus on its application in **Data Analysis**. The goal is to empower newcomers to write efficient queries and confidently extract meaningful insights from relational databases.

## üéØ Why SQL for Data Analysis?

SQL is the *lingua franca* of the data world. For any aspiring Data Scientist or Data Analyst, mastering SQL is non-negotiable. It is the essential skill required to:
* Filter, manipulate, and clean large datasets.
* Perform essential aggregations and statistical calculations.
* Combine data seamlessly from multiple tables using **Joins**.
* Build and maintain robust data pipelines.

## üìö Topics Covered (Repository Structure)

The concepts and commands are organized to build a solid foundation, progressing from basic data retrieval to more complex analytical operations:

1.  **Basic Selection:** `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `DISTINCT`.
2.  **Filtering & Sorting:** `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `ORDER BY`.
3.  **Aggregation & Statistics:** `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`.
4.  **Joins (Connecting Data):** `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`.
5.  **Data Manipulation (DML - for Practice):** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
